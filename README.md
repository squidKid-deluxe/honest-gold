**Title: Technical Deep Dive into the HONEST Network: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Stability, Liquidity, and Flexibility in Decentralized Finance**

*Abstract:*

This technical paper delves into the intricate workings of the HONEST network, an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the BitShares blockchain. Exploring the core features, including Market Pegged Assets (MPAs), the Black Swan Response Method (BSRM), constant-product liquidity pools, and credit offers, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how HONEST achieves stability, liquidity, and flexibility in the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized financial systems.

**1. Introduction: Unveiling the HONEST Network**

In the ever-expanding realm of decentralized finance (DeFi), where blockchain technology reshapes traditional financial paradigms, the HONEST network emerges as a beacon of innovation. Devised to transcend the limitations of centralized systems, HONEST encapsulates a decentralized ecosystem that leverages cutting-edge blockchain principles to redefine the landscape of financial interactions.

At the core of the HONEST network lies the concept of decentralized liquidity poolsâ€”an autonomous, on-chain mechanism that orchestrates liquidity without the need for traditional order books. These pools, operating on the constant product model, facilitate seamless asset exchanges, underpinning a dynamic and efficient trading environment within the HONEST blockchain.

Market Pegged Assets (MPAs), a cornerstone of the HONEST network, introduces a novel approach to stability. Distinguished from User Issued Assets (UIAs), MPAs leverage collateral and smart contracts to peg their value to conventional assets, ensuring resilience against market volatility. The network dynamically adjusts supply through collateralization, providing a robust foundation for various assets, such as the HONEST stablecoin.

SmartCoins, exemplified by (Bit)USD, (Bit)CNY, and others, epitomize the synergy of innovation and stability within HONEST. With 100% or more value backed by the core currency (BTS), these collateralized tokens eliminate counterparty risk. HONEST's unique approach ensures that the network, governed by a software protocol, secures collateral and executes settlements, introducing a new paradigm in decentralized financial instruments.

The intricate dance of Margin Call Mechanics plays a pivotal role in fortifying positions within the HONEST network. Delving into the calculations of call prices, collateral ratios, and nuanced execution conditions, we unravel the mechanism by which the market compels participants to sell collateral, maintaining equilibrium and mitigating risks. The delicate balance between Short Squeeze Protection Ratios (SQPR) and Maintenance Collateral Ratios (MCR), carefully managed by network witnesses, further fortifies HONEST's decentralized financial ecosystem.

Navigating through the nuanced realm of short selling BitAssets, participants enhance exposure to BTS and contribute liquidity to HONEST assets like USD, EUR, GOLD, and more. Borrowing, margin calls, settlements, and covering positions become integral steps in this intricate dance where flexibility meets market behavior, offering users the potential to engage with the blockchain in innovative ways.

As we embark on this journey through the inner workings of HONEST, the synthesis of decentralized liquidity pools, stable Market Pegged Assets, robust Margin Call Mechanics, and dynamic short selling unfolds. Together, they weave a tapestry that exemplifies the transformative power of decentralized financial ecosystems. HONEST stands as a testament to innovation, resilience, and the boundless possibilities inherent in blockchain technology. Join us in unveiling the layers of this decentralized financial landscape, where HONEST paves the way for a future where financial interactions are transparent, efficient, and accessible to all.

**2. Market Pegged Assets (MPAs) on BitShares: Empowering Stability through Algorithmic Precision**

The core of the HONEST network's financial stability resides in the innovative concept of Market Pegged Assets (MPAs), a sophisticated mechanism designed to provide users with digital assets that closely track the value of globally recognized fiat currencies. In this section, we embark on a detailed exploration of how MPAs operate on the BitShares blockchain, demystifying their unique properties and the underlying collateralized debt positions (CDPs) that contribute to their stability.

*2.1 Overview of MPAs: Navigating the World of Algorithmic Stability*

Imagine a digital currency that mirrors the value of traditional fiat currencies, offering users the convenience and reliability of a stable unit of value in the decentralized realm. MPAs are precisely that - freely traded digital assets on BitShares that maintain a peg to conventional currencies. Unlike User Issued Assets (UIAs), which are susceptible to issuer control over supply, MPAs operate on the principles of algorithmic precision, removing centralized authority and fostering trust in the decentralized landscape.

To understand the magic of MPAs, let's delve into the realm of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs). In simple terms, users looking to expand the supply of their native tokens contribute collateral, allowing them to borrow new coins. This introduces a delicate dance between debt, collateral, and algorithmically defined ratios to ensure a stable and reliable digital representation of traditional currencies.

*2.2 Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs): The Guardians of Stability*

At the heart of MPAs lies the concept of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), acting as the guardians of stability by establishing and enforcing collateral requirements for each MPA. The collateral ratio, defined by the maintenance collateral ratio (MCR), plays a pivotal role in averting excessive borrowing and mitigating counterparty risks.

Let's break down the MCR to demystify its significance. Suppose a user wishes to borrow new coins by contributing collateral. The MCR serves as a buffer, ensuring that the collateral provided is sufficiently robust to cover the borrowed amount. The user must maintain a collateral ratio above the MCR to prevent their position from entering risky territory. This clever mechanism prevents the system from falling into a state of imbalance and reinforces the resilience of the HONEST network.

*2.3 Dancing with Debt and Collateral: Calculating Call Price*

Now, let's explore the concept of the call price, a crucial parameter in the MPA ecosystem. The call price is determined by the ratio of debt to collateral, guided by the MCR. In a hypothetical scenario where a user has opened a position with a debt of 10 USD and collateral of 10000 BTS, and the MCR is set at 1.75, the call price is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Call Price} = \frac{\text{Collateral}}{\text{Debt} \times \text{MCR}} \]

In this example, the call price would be \( \frac{10000 \, \text{BTS}}{10 \, \text{USD} \times 1.75} = 571.429 \, \text{BTS/USD} \).

This seemingly complex equation encapsulates the delicate balance between borrowed assets and collateral, ensuring that the call price accurately reflects the market conditions and prevents undue risks in the HONEST network.

*2.4 Empowering Users with Algorithmic Precision*

As users navigate the HONEST network, the power of MPAs becomes evident. Algorithmic precision eliminates the need for centralized control over supply, promoting transparency and trust among participants. The interplay of Collateralized Debt Positions, maintenance collateral ratios, and call prices forms an intricate dance, guiding the HONEST network toward a state of financial equilibrium.

In the next section, we'll unravel the Black Swan Response Method (BSRM), a dynamic mechanism designed to respond to extreme price movements and fortify the stability of the HONEST network. Through the lens of algorithmic innovation, HONEST continues to redefine decentralized finance, offering users a reliable and resilient platform within the BitShares blockchain.

**3. Black Swan Response Method (BSRM): Safeguarding Stability in Extreme Markets**

As the HONEST network orchestrates a delicate dance between algorithmic precision and decentralized finance, the Black Swan Response Method (BSRM) emerges as a guardian against the unpredictable storms of extreme market movements. In this section, we embark on a detailed exploration of the BSRM, unraveling its intricacies and understanding how it contributes to fortifying the stability of the HONEST network in the face of Black Swan events.

*3.1 Black Swan Events: Navigating the Unpredictable*

In the financial world, Black Swan events represent unforeseen and extreme market occurrences that defy conventional predictions. These events, by their nature, introduce volatility and chaos, challenging the stability of any financial system. In the decentralized realm of HONEST, the BSRM stands as a resilient shield against the impact of Black Swans, responding dynamically to market dynamics and ensuring the network's robustness in the face of adversity.

*3.2 The Essence of Black Swan Response Method (BSRM)*

At the core of the BSRM lies a dynamic response mechanism tailored to address extreme price movements and maintain the integrity of the HONEST network. The method combines algorithmic calculations with a proactive approach, aiming to mitigate the risks associated with Black Swan events.

The essential components of the BSRM include:

    a. Settle Quote Price Ratio (SQPR)
    b. Maintenance Collateral Ratio (MCR)
    c. Squeeze Protection Price (SQPP)

Together, these elements form a sophisticated response framework that allows the HONEST network to navigate through extreme market conditions without compromising its stability.

*3.3 Settle Quote Price Ratio (SQPR): A Strategic Parameter*

The SQPR serves as a strategic parameter within the BSRM, defining the conditions under which margin calls are triggered to address extreme market volatility. To comprehend the SQPR's role, consider a scenario where the settlement price is 300 BTS/USD, and the SQPR is set at 1.1. This means that any margin position with a call price below 330 BTS/USD will be forced to settle.

\[ \text{SQPP} = \text{Settlement Price} \times \text{SQPR} \]

In the example, if the SQPP is calculated as \( 300 \, \text{BTS/USD} \times 1.1 = 330 \, \text{BTS/USD} \), any position with a call price below this threshold will be proactively settled, providing a protective buffer against extreme market fluctuations.

*3.4 Maintenance Collateral Ratio (MCR): The Buffer Zone*

The MCR, acting as a buffer zone, plays a pivotal role in defining a safety net for margin positions. It represents the minimum required collateral ratio set by witnesses to prevent positions from entering a precarious state. Consider a scenario where a position with a debt of 10 USD and a settlement price of 300 BTS/USD has an initial collateral ratio of 1. With an MCR of 1.75, the collateral is recalculated to 5250 BTS to maintain a safer position.

\[ \text{Collateral} = \text{Debt} \times \text{MCR} \]

In this instance, the call price aligns with the feed price, ensuring that the position remains robust even in the face of market volatility.

*3.5 Squeeze Protection Price (SQPP): Safeguarding Against Squeezes*

The SQPP acts as the upper limit, safeguarding margin positions from forced settlements at exorbitant prices. In the context of the HONEST network, it represents the maximum price at which a margin position will be compelled to pay to cover.

\[ \text{SQPP} = \text{Settlement Price} \times \text{SQPR} \]

Understanding the SQPP's significance requires acknowledging its role in preventing forced margin calls from executing at excessively high prices. This protective feature ensures that the network remains resilient and capable of navigating through extreme market conditions without succumbing to undue risks.

*3.6 Navigating the Dynamics: SQPR and Collateral Ratio*

To delve deeper into the BSRM dynamics, let's consider the relationship between the SQPR and the collateral ratio, offering insights into maintaining a safe position in the HONEST network.

\[ \text{Safe Position: CR > MCR \times SQPR} \]

In essence, to remain secure and avoid margin calls, a margin position must uphold a collateral ratio higher than the product of the MCR and SQPR. This equation captures the delicate balance between safety and flexibility, enabling participants to navigate the volatile landscape of Black Swan events.

*3.7 Market Response and Execution: A Visual Journey*

Now, let's visualize the execution of a margin call within the context of extreme market movements. Assume a scenario with the following parameters:

    SQPR: 1.

2
    MCR: 1.75
    SQPR * MCR: 2.1
    Settlement Price: 300 BTS/USD
    SQPP: 300 * 1.2 = 360 BTS/USD
    Debt: 10 USD
    Collateral: 5687.5
    CR: 1.896
    Call Price: 325 BTS/USD

This situation warrants a margin call, as the collateral ratio of 1.896 falls below the safe ratio of 2.1. The margin call order will buy any USD priced in the range of 325-360 BTS/USD. The SQPP acts as a safeguard, preventing the forced margin order from executing at excessively high prices, ensuring that the network responds strategically to extreme market conditions.

*3.8 Consequences and Nuances: A Complex Landscape*

The BSRM introduces several nuances and consequences, creating a complex landscape that necessitates careful consideration. One key consequence involves the range within which margin calls execute, defined as \([ \text{Call Price} - \text{SQPP} ]\). This range introduces intricacies in market dynamics, preventing margin calls from executing at prices below the call price but within the SQPP range. For example, if a sell order exists at 315 BTS/USD, the margin call order will not utilize it, creating a dynamic market scenario where strategic considerations play a pivotal role.

*3.9 Market Manipulation: The Tug of War*

In the realm of market manipulation, the BSRM introduces a tug of war between shorts and longs, offering both sides an equal opportunity to influence market dynamics in their favor. A large force-settle order becomes an opportunity for shorts to engage in reverse manipulation, creating a dynamic equilibrium that reflects the fair market price at a given point in time.

In essence, the BSRM ensures that market manipulation is not a guaranteed win for potential manipulators, introducing strategic considerations that level the playing field for participants.

*3.10 Beyond the Horizon: BSRM's Role in Decentralized Finance*

As we journey beyond the nuances and intricacies of the BSRM, it becomes evident that this method plays a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of decentralized finance within the HONEST network. By dynamically responding to extreme market conditions, mitigating risks associated with Black Swan events, and introducing strategic considerations for market participants, the BSRM stands as a testament to the resilience and innovation inherent in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

In the upcoming section, we transition our exploration to the Liquidity Pool Technical, unraveling the automated and autonomous on-chain liquidity provided by BitShares-core 5.0. Join us as we navigate through the intricacies of liquidity pools, understanding their functions in facilitating seamless exchanges within the HONEST network.

**4. Liquidity Pool Technical: Unraveling On-Chain Liquidity Dynamics**

In the intricate tapestry of decentralized finance, Liquidity Pools emerge as a fundamental mechanism to enhance trading efficiency and facilitate seamless exchanges. In this section, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of Liquidity Pool Technical within the HONEST network, unraveling the intricate dynamics that define on-chain liquidity.

*4.1 The Essence of Liquidity Pools*

Liquidity Pools, seamlessly integrated into the HONEST core 5.0, stand as a cornerstone of the HONEST network's decentralized financial infrastructure. These pools, characterized by automated and autonomous on-chain liquidity, play a pivotal role in ensuring that assets within the HONEST ecosystem remain liquid and readily tradable.

*4.2 Dynamics of Liquidity Pools*

At the heart of Liquidity Pools lies the principle of maintaining an equal value of assets in the pool, adjusting dynamically based on market demand and supply. To comprehend the dynamics, consider the constant product model, denoted by 'k,' where the product of the amount of Asset X and Asset Y remains constant.

\[ k = \text{amount}_X \times \text{amount}_Y \]

Additionally, Liquidity Pools introduce a pool taker fee, contributing to the pool token holders and incentivizing participants to engage in liquidity provision.

*4.3 Exchange Function: The Constant Product Model*

The exchange function within Liquidity Pools is defined by the constant product model, where the product 'k' remains unchanged. This model ensures that the pool always holds an equal amount of value in both assets at the current pool price. The exchange rate is dynamically adjusted based on market demand, providing a mechanism for efficient and decentralized trading.

*4.4 Deposit Function: Increasing Pool Tokens*

Initiating a deposit in a Liquidity Pool involves providing both assets in equal amounts at the current pool price. This action increases the total amount of pool tokens, representing the participant's share in the liquidity pool.

*4.5 Withdraw Function: Managing Liquidity Withdrawals*

Conversely, the withdraw function involves removing funds from the pool, effectively burning the pool token and reducing the total supply. Withdrawal fees are distributed among the remaining pool token holders, introducing an incentive mechanism to encourage participants to stay engaged in the liquidity pool.

*4.6 Create Function: Bootstrapping a UIA*

The creation of a User Issued Asset (UIA) within Liquidity Pools is initiated by establishing a new UIA that can be subsequently upgraded to a pool token. In this process, the asset ID A is inherently smaller than the asset ID B. Following the initial pool deposit by the creator, the invariant 'k' is defined, and the liquidity pool becomes active, contributing to the overall liquidity of the HONEST network.

*4.7 Liquidity Pool Exploration: A User Interface Journey*

Navigating the user interface of the HONEST network, users can easily distinguish between Market Pegged Assets (MPAs) and User Issued Assets (UIAs) in the asset explorer. The clear distinction simplifies the user experience, enabling seamless engagement with the diverse range of assets offered within the decentralized financial ecosystem.

*4.8 SmartCoins: The Intelligent HONEST Assets*

Within Liquidity Pools, SmartCoins emerge as a unique category, owned and created by anyone on the network. Notable among these are HONEST USD, HONEST CNY, HONEST EUR, HONEST GOLD, and HONEST Silver. Labeled with their respective fiat values, SmartCoins represent assets that always have 100% or more of their value backed by the HONEST core currency (HONEST). This backing ensures their convertibility at any time, serving as collateral in a Contract for Difference (CFD).

*4.9 Collateralized Tokens: The Heart of MPAs*

Collateralized Tokens, synonymous with Market Pegged Assets (MPAs), embody a crypto-currency model with 100% or more of their value backed by the HONEST core currency (HONEST). This backing facilitates conversion at any time, acting as collateral within a CFD. What sets MPAs apart is their freedom from counterparty risk, achieved through the network itself (implemented as a software protocol) taking responsibility for securing collateral and executing settlements.

*4.10 Market Mechanics: Orchestrating a Symphony*

Every HONEST Asset within the HONEST network is equipped with a feed provided by witnesses, indicating the Settlement Price or Feed Price. This price, crucial for margin call mechanics, determines the trigger for positions that borrowed HONEST Assets. To maintain the minimum collateral ratio, collateral from these positions is automatically used to buy back the debt from the market, resulting in position closure. This orchestrated symphony within the market mechanics enforces participants to maintain collateral higher than the minimum requirement.

As we immerse ourselves in the intricate dynamics of Liquidity Pools, we gain a nuanced understanding of their pivotal role in shaping the decentralized financial landscape within the HONEST network. In the subsequent section, we transition our exploration to the revolutionary concept of Margin Call Mechanics, unraveling the mechanisms that ensure the stability and integrity of the decentralized finance ecosystem. Join us on this journey through the inner workings of HONEST, where each element contributes to the seamless functioning of a decentralized financial paradigm.

**5. Margin Call Mechanics: Navigating the Waves of Stability**

Embarking on a journey into the heart of the HONEST network, we delve into the intricacies of Margin Call Mechanicsâ€”a critical mechanism that ensures stability, risk mitigation, and the safeguarding of assets within the decentralized financial ecosystem. As we navigate these waves of stability, let's demystify the mechanics, explore the nuanced calculations, and understand the pivotal role of margin calls in maintaining equilibrium.

*5.1 Understanding the Margin Call: A Prelude*

A margin call, within the HONEST network, is akin to the market compelling a participant to sell collateral, acquiring enough HONEST assets to settle their position. In simpler terms, it is an order to buy HONEST assets using the participant's collateral, triggered when the price surge renders the collateral insufficient based on the maintenance collateral ratio (MCR). The MCR, a parameter fine-tuned by witnesses (akin to validators in traditional systems), sets the threshold for collateral adequacy.

*5.2 Calculating the Call Price: A Mathematical Exploration*

The call price, a pivotal factor in margin call mechanics, hinges on the amount of debt and collateral in a position, independent of the settlement price. Let's walk through an example to grasp the intricacies. Suppose a participant initiates a position with:

    Debt: 10 HONEST
    Collateral: 10000 BTS
    MCR: 1.75

The call price of this position, calculated as \(\frac{10000 \text{ BTS}}{10 \times 1.75 \text{ HONEST}}\), amounts to 571.429 BTS/HONEST. This calculated value represents the threshold beyond which the position becomes vulnerable to a margin call.

*5.3 Understanding Collateral Ratio: A Balancing Act*

Collateral ratio (CR) plays a crucial role in determining the health of a margin position. Dependent on the feed price (settlement price), the collateral ratio is calculated by dividing the collateral value in BTS by the debt value in HONEST. For instance, given a feed price of 300 BTS/HONEST, a position with 10 HONEST debt and 10000 BTS collateral yields a CR of \( \frac{10000 \text{ BTS}}{300 \text{ BTS/HONEST} \times 10 \text{ HONEST}} = 3.33\).

*5.4 Execution Conditions: Unraveling the Triggers*

The initiation of a margin call is a nuanced process governed by specific conditions. Margin calls are only possible if the feed price falls below the call price, rendering the position susceptible to liquidation. A critical safeguard against extreme market conditions is the Black Swan level, a scenario where the collateral ratio drops to a precarious level. The introduction of the Maintenance Collateral Ratio (MCR) acts as a buffer, preventing positions from reaching the Black Swan territory.

To delve deeper, let's examine two scenarios with distinct Short Squeeze Protection Ratios (SQPR)â€”a mechanism setting a threshold above which margin calls trigger.

**5.4.1 SQPR of 1.1: Balancing Risk and Reward**

Consider a scenario with a Settlement Price of 300 BTS/HONEST and an SQPR of 1.1. In this case, the Squeeze Protection Price (SQPP) is calculated as \(300 \text{ BTS/HONEST} \times 1.1 = 330 \text{ BTS/HONEST}\). Any position with a call price below 330 BTS/HONEST would be compelled to settle, acting as a bid in the market to buy HONEST assets for BTS.

**5.4.2 SQPR of 1.5: A Stricter Threshold**

Now, envision a scenario with an SQPR of 1.5, resulting in a SQPP of \(300 \text{ BTS/HONEST} \times 1.5 = 450 \text{ BTS/HONEST}\). In this stringent scenario, only positions with a call price below 450 BTS/HONEST would face liquidation.

*5.5 Margin Call Execution: Charting the Course*

Amidst the complexities, one pivotal question surfaces: At what price does the margin call execute? The execution, often misunderstood, involves selling collateral to buy HONEST assets within a defined range, specifically \([ \text{Call Price} - \text{SQPP} ]\).

To illustrate, let's consider a fictional USD:HONEST market with parameters such as SQPR of 1.2, MCR of 1.75, SQPR * MCR of 2.1, a Settlement Price of 300 BTS/USD, and a SQPP of 360 BTS/USD. With a debt of 10 USD, collateral of 5687.5 BTS, a CR of 1.896, and a Call Price of 325 BTS/USD, the margin call buy region spans from 325 to 360 BTS/USD.

As we navigate the nuanced terrain of margin call mechanics, we uncover the delicate balance struck to maintain stability within the HONEST network. The intricacies of CR, SQPR, and execution conditions collectively contribute to a robust decentralized financial ecosystem, ensuring resilience in the face of market fluctuations. As we conclude this section, the journey through the inner workings of HONEST continues, leading us to further revelations in the realm of decentralized finance.

**6. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Decentralized Finance**

From the foundational principles of decentralized liquidity pools to the dynamic world of Market Pegged Assets (MPAs) and SmartCoins, each component plays a vital role in shaping the financial landscape of HONEST.

As we embarked on our journey, we uncovered the significance of liquidity poolsâ€”autonomous, on-chain entities that hold equal value in both assets, facilitating seamless exchanges within the HONEST network. These pools, driven by the constant product model and augmented by taker fees, empower users to contribute liquidity, fostering efficient market dynamics.

Market Pegged Assets (MPAs), exemplified by BitAssets, emerged as a cornerstone of stability in the HONEST network. Unlike User Issued Assets (UIAs), MPAs leverage collateral and a fair market price to track the value of conventional underlying assets. Through smart contracts and collateralization, the network dynamically adjusts supply, ensuring robustness against market fluctuations.

The intricacies of SmartCoins, exemplified by (Bit)USD, (Bit)CNY, and others, showcase assets backed by the core currency (BTS) with 100% or more value. These collateralized tokens, free from counterparty risk, embody the innovative spirit of HONEST, where the network itself takes responsibility for securing collateral and executing settlements.

Navigating the waves of stability brought us to the heart of Margin Call Mechanicsâ€”a mechanism safeguarding positions within the HONEST network. As we dived into the calculations, understanding call prices, collateral ratios, and the nuanced execution conditions, a clearer picture emerged. Margin calls, triggered when the market forces a participant to sell collateral, play a pivotal role in maintaining equilibrium and mitigating risk.

The interplay of Short Squeeze Protection Ratios (SQPR) and Maintenance Collateral Ratios (MCR) adds an additional layer of resilience. These parameters, meticulously managed by witnesses, set the stage for a robust decentralized financial ecosystem. From SQPR defining thresholds for margin calls to MCR acting as a buffer against extreme market conditions, HONEST encapsulates a delicate balance to ensure the stability of assets.

In the dynamic realm of short selling BitAssets, participants can enhance exposure to BTS, offering liquidity to HONEST assets like USD, EUR, GOLD, and more. Borrowing, margin calls, settlements, and covering positionsâ€”all unfold as integral steps in this intricate dance, where flexibility meets market behavior.

As we conclude our journey through the inner workings of HONEST, we recognize the symbiotic relationship between these components. Decentralized liquidity pools bolstered by market dynamics, Market Pegged Assets ensuring stability, and Margin Call Mechanics fortifying against risksâ€”all weave together into the tapestry of decentralized finance. In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, HONEST stands as a testament to innovation, resilience, and the limitless potential of decentralized financial ecosystems. The journey continues, beckoning us to explore further and embrace the transformative possibilities that lie ahead.
