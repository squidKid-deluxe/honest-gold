        <h1>Margin Calls on the BitShares Blockchain: Mechanisms and Dynamics</h1>
        <h2>Abstract:</h2>
        <p>
            This paper elucidates the intricate mechanics of margin calls on the BitShares
            blockchain, focusing on the USD:BTS market and utilizing examples with HONEST.CNY,
            HONEST.USD, etc. It provides clarity on what margin calls are, how they are initiated,
            the calculation of call prices, and the nuances involved in their execution.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            Margin calls play a pivotal role in maintaining stability and adherence to collateral
            requirements in the BitShares ecosystem. This paper aims to demystify the mechanics
            behind margin calls, shedding light on their significance in markets like HONEST.CNY:BTS
            and HONEST.USD:BTS.
        </p>
        <h2>2. What is a Margin Call?</h2>
        <p>
            A margin call in BitShares compels a user to sell collateral, converting it into the
            borrowed token to settle their position. In the HONEST.USD:BTS market, a margin call
            equates to a bid order to buy HONEST.USD with BTS. It is triggered when the price surge
            renders the user’s collateral insufficient, violating the BitShares market rules.
        </p>
        <h3>2.1. How is the Call Price Calculated?</h3>
        <p>
            The call price (CP) of a margin position relies on the Maintenance Collateral Ratio
            (MCR), debt, and collateral:
        </p>
        <p>
            $$<br />
            \text{Call Price (CP)} = \frac{\text{Collateral}}{\text{Debt} \times \text{MCR}}<br />
            $$
        </p>
        <h3>2.2. How is the Collateral Ratio (CR) Calculated?</h3>
        <p>The collateral ratio (CR) is determined by the feed price (settlement price):</p>
        <p>
            $$<br />
            \text{Collateral Ratio (CR)} = \frac{\frac{\text{Collateral}}{\text{Feed
            Price}}}{\text{Debt}}<br />
            $$
        </p>
        <h2>3. Execution Conditions:</h2>
        <h3>3.1. When Will a Margin Call Happen?</h3>
        <p>
            Margin calls are contingent on the feed price being below the call price. The Squeeze
            Protection Price (SQPP) and Squeeze Protection Ratio (SQPR) play crucial roles in
            determining the conditions for executing a margin call. The SQPP is calculated as
            follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            $$<br />
            \text{SQPP} = \text{Feed Price} \times \text{SQPR}<br />
            $$
        </p>
        <h3>3.2. At What Price Will the Margin Call Execute?</h3>
        <p>
            The margin call executes within the range \([CP - SQPP]\). This introduces complexities
            where execution may not occur at lower prices due to blocking sell orders.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Discussion:</h2>
        <p>
            The collateral ratio, SQPR, and MCR collectively determine the safety and timing of
            margin calls. Ensuring a collateral ratio higher than \(MCR \times SQPR\) is essential
            to avoid margin calls.
        </p>
        <h3>4.1. Consequences:</h3>
        <h4>4.1.1. Asks Below the Call Price Prevent Margin Calls:</h4>
        <p>
            Margin calls only execute in the range \([CP - SQPP]\), hindering execution when there
            are lower-priced sell orders.
        </p>
        <h4>4.1.2. Margin Calls Cannot “Buy Cheap”:</h4>
        <p>
            Forced margin calls consistently buy at a premium relative to the settlement price, even
            if lower-priced sell orders are available.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>
            Margin calls are intricate processes within the BitShares blockchain, ensuring adherence
            to collateral requirements and market stability. Understanding the interplay of
            parameters like MCR, SQPR, and execution ranges is crucial for participants engaging in
            leveraged positions with assets like HONEST.CNY and HONEST.USD.
